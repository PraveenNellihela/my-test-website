Can you become a better learner? The quick simple answer: yes, you can. You can learn better, more effectively and keep what you learned in your memory.

If you would like to know how, stick around a bit more and we’ll explore how you can be the best version of yourself when it comes to learning and studying.

## Can I increase my learning capacity or am I stuck with it the way I was born?

Believe it or not, most of the qualities you have, can be improved, if you want to. Take your strength for example. If you exercise regularly, maintain a good diet, you will become healthier and stronger.

By this logic, your mind should the same. It can be improved with regular “exercise”. A quick google search revealed the following:

> Intelligence is not a fixed state. Your brain is designed to improve with experience by developing new neural pathways.

The brain is actually a very fascinating biological device.

But, it’s better to fact check. Can this really be? I wanted to find scientifically backed evidence. So, I did some research on websites like PubMed. The results are mixed, with some scientific communities stating that it is possible to train your brain while some stating you cannot, while some say that there are not enough tools to measure this. Somewhat disappointing. Somewhat promising.

However, I did find some scientifically backed tools that can help with studies. Let’s have a look.

**ICAP Framework:** This framework compares different ways of studying and how effective they are. In summary, learning by just reading or watching a video was the least effective. If you combine the above, with note taking, self studying and discussions, learning was found to be most effective.
